/**
 * The research behind the plan: Washington cases in which the decedent died
 * intestate.
 *
 * Why intestacy, for a matter that is making a will? Because the will exists to
 * beat the statute. Cornelius Montgomery has no spouse and no issue, so if he
 * died today the residue would pass by descent to his collateral kindred —
 * nearly, but not exactly, the division he wants. Every case below is a
 * Washington estate that went that way, and read together they are the argument
 * for signing something.
 *
 * The full opinions live in `src/research/opinions/` as text, pulled from the
 * Caselaw Access Project. This module is the index the portal renders; the
 * folder is the corpus. Neither is a citator — no treatment has been verified.
 *
 * Data lives here rather than inside a component for the same reason the matter
 * does — see `matter.ts`. A real portal replaces this module with a same-origin
 * read against Navigator's `/app/api`.
