# Navigator Sample Project — Estate

A **project application** for [Navigator](https://github.com/neon-law-source-code/navigator): the client portal for the
fixture matter *Estate of Cornelius Montgomery*. [Navigator UX](https://github.com/neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux)
supplies every component and every color; Vite and React 19 do the rest.

It exists so that "attach a React application to a matter" has a worked example a contributor can read, clone, and copy
— and so Navigator's own local development loop has something real to build and serve. It is one of three, each a
different shape of legal work: [litigation](https://github.com/neon-law-staging/sample-litigation),
[transactional](https://github.com/neon-law-staging/sample-transactional), and
[estate](https://github.com/neon-law-staging/sample-estate).

**Everything here is fixture data.** *Estate of Cornelius Montgomery* is a simulated matter, and nobody named in this
repository is a real person. No client data belongs in a public repository, ever.

## The matter

This is the **estate** sample. Cornelius Montgomery has no spouse and no children, and wants his estate divided among
his nieces and nephews.

That is the whole reason the matter exists. Nevada intestacy would already divide the residue among the next degree of
kindred by operation of law — which is very nearly what he wants, and "very nearly" is what a will is for. Intestacy
cannot express an unequal share, cannot name a personal representative, and cannot hold a beneficiary's gift in trust
until they are old enough for it.

Shares are held in **basis points** rather than percentages, and a test asserts they sum to exactly 10,000. A share
table that does not add up is the one bug in this repository that would matter: percentages of an estate are the classic
place a rounding error becomes a dispute between people who have just lost someone.

## Where it mounts

Navigator serves this bundle at:

```text
/app/projects/sample-estate/portal/
```

`sample-estate` is the Project code; `portal` is a literal segment of Navigator's route, not an application name it
looks up. Navigator streams the bytes through its own origin behind the session cookie and the participation gate; it
never redirects to a signed URL, because a signed URL is bearer-shareable and would not carry the session.

That has three consequences for this app:

1. **Vite `base` is baked at build time** and must be `/app/projects/sample-estate/portal/`. A bundle built with the
   wrong base 404s on every asset. It is one named constant at the top of `portal/vite.config.ts`.
2. **Never hardcode a mount-absolute link.** Write links relative to the base, or derive them — `portal/src/mount.ts` is
   the whole of that job, and `portalPath()` is what every in-bundle link goes through. Hardcoded `/sample-estate/...`
   strings are the single most common way one of these bundles breaks under its real mount, and they break silently,
   because the link only fails when somebody clicks it. Links to Navigator's *own* routes (`/app/projects`) stay
   absolute.
3. **Same-origin is the whole mechanism.** Because the bundle is served from Navigator's origin, its calls to
   Navigator's read and command APIs are session-gated automatically. There is no backend in this repository.

The serve CSP is:

```text
default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'
```

Nothing in this bundle is inline or off-origin, which is why it needs no exception — and
`portal/src/test/bundle.test.ts` asserts that against the built output rather than trusting it. In particular there is
no CDN tag for a stylesheet or a webfont: Navigator UX's stylesheet and its two self-hosted woff2 files are compiled
into hashed assets under this matter's own mount, because a CDN tag works on the dev server and is blocked in
production.

## The one contract Navigator depends on

The bundle must show that it actually mounted, through an element carrying:

```text
id="sample-estate-portal-ready"
```

Navigator's browser walkthrough waits for it. It is rendered by React (`portal/src/ready.tsx`), never written into
`portal/index.html` — a static marker would report "ready" for a bundle that threw on mount, which is the exact failure
the signal exists to catch.

## Which Project this bundle belongs to

`navigator.yaml` declares it:

```yaml
project: sample-estate
```

Navigator re-reads that file at boot rather than trusting the directory the bundle was staged in, and refuses a bundle
naming a different Project. That is what lets three sample bundles be staged side by side: publishing one under the
wrong code would put this matter's application on another matter's portal.

## Developing

```bash
pnpm --dir portal install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir portal dev                          # the Vite dev server
pnpm --dir portal check                        # lint, typecheck, build, test — what CI runs
```

To build it the way Navigator does, from a Navigator checkout:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- dev sample-project --project sample-estate
```

That clones, builds, and stages this bundle for the next local `web` boot. Restart `web` afterwards so it reads the
newly staged output.
